## Project Vision  
Choosing the right career path is often overwhelming due to rapidly evolving technologies, skill requirements, and job markets. Our AI Career Advisor aims to bridge this gap by creating a **research-backed, data-driven platform** that guides learners and professionals through personalized recommendations, roadmaps, and insights.  

This project is a **prototype** built purely for **showcasing our idea**. All data is **hardcoded** (no backend integration) to simulate the user journey, but the design and logic are inspired by real-world research into career development, skill-demand reports, and AI-powered advisory systems.
